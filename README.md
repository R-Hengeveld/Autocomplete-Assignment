# Autocomplete-Assignment

### Thoughts and process

- Just started out creating a basic project with some simple input fields
- Decided to separate html/vue & scss files for cleaner code
- First work on getting the autocomplete/search for cities to work
- Next making sure it works by just searching for book title
- Create a bit smoother experience, by switching between both autocompletes in 1 input
